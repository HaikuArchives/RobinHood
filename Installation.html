	<P>The latest version of Robin Hood can be found under the Robin Hood entry at <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/" TARGET="_new">BeBits</A>.
	<BR>Robin Hood requires <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/323" TARGET="_new">libHTTP</A> 1.0b to run. libHTTP 1.0b is included with this distribution
	of Robin Hood; it is also available separately with source code.</P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Installing libHTTP</B></FONT>
	<P>As long as all of the executables remain in their original directory,
	they will be able to find libHTTP in the <I>lib</I> directory. Optionally, you
	may move the file <I>lib/libHTTP.so</I> to "/boot/home/config/lib/." This will
	allow the executables to be placed anywhere you wish and permits other apps to
	use libHTTP.</P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Installing the Add-On Modules</B></FONT>
	<P>As long as the folder <I>robin_hood_modules</I> remains in the same folder as the 
	<I>rhdaemon</I>, they will be found. Optionally, this folder may be moved to 
	"/boot/home/config/add-ons/."</P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>404 Template File</B></FONT>
	<P>The 404 Handler looks for a file named "404.html" in the root of your web directory. 
	A sample 404.html file is provided which you can use. If you don't have a template 
	404 file, you will get a plain "404 File Not Found" message when a file could not be 
	found.
	</P> 
	
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>File Permissions</B></FONT>
	<P>Robin Hood respects the file permission attributes of the files in your web directory. 
	If you find you are being asked for a password when viewing your web-site, 
	you probably need to fix the permission attributes. Separate permissions are maintained 
	by the file system for owner, group, and other users. Each class is further sub-divided into read, write, 
	and execute permissions. Robin Hood will require a password for a file if others do not have 
	read access to the file; CGIs require execute access.
	<P>Access permissions can be changed with the "chmod" command. If you wish to make your entire web directory public, 
	use the command:<BR>chmod -R o+r <I>path</I><BR>
	where <I>path</I> is the path to your web directory. The CGI directory permission should be set with:<BR>
	chmod -R o+x <I>path</I><BR>
	where <I>path</I> is the path of the CGI directory.</P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Robin Hood Executables</B></FONT>
	<P>Robin Hood includes serveral executable components. The user interface and the server 
	are separate. The server can continue running in the background even after the UI has 
	exited.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>rhdaemon</B></FONT>
		<BR>This is the Robin Hood server. It runs in the background and 
		has no visible UI. It can be started by launching it from the tracker, the command-line, 
		or from the Robin Hood Console. The rhdaemon can be placed anywhere you like as long 
		as libHTTP is in the /boot/home/config/lib/ directory. If you wish to have the server start automatically on 
		startup, add the following line to your UserBootscript:<BR>
		<I>path</I>/rhdaemon &amp;<BR>
		where <I>path</I> is the location of the rhdaemon on your computer.</LI>
		<LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>RHConsole</B></FONT>
		<BR>This is a graphical console for RobinHood. It displays a 
		connection log, reports on the status of the server, has controls for starting and 
		stopping the server, and can open the Robin Hood configuration file. It includes a filter menu; this allows you to control what is 
		displayed in the log. RHConsole does not have to be running for the server to be 
		running.</LI>
		<LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>RHLog</B></FONT>
		<BR>This is a command line console for the rhdaemon. It outputs log 
		entries to stdout and can filter what types of entries are displayed. It should 
		reside in the /boot/home/config/bin/ directory for convenient access. It can be 
		made to log all server transactions to the file <I>RHLog</I> by adding the following line to 
		your UserBootscript: rhlog >> /boot/home/config/setting/RHLog &amp;<BR>
		It could also be used over a telnet session to monitor the web server. Type 
		"rhlog --help" for a list of filtering options.</LI>
	</UL>
	
	<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Configuring the Virtual Hosts File</B></FONT>
	<P>The Virtual Hosts File contains the configuration info for the rhdaemon.
	You can open this file from the "File" menu of RHConsole or by opening
	<A HREF="file:///boot/home/config/settings/virtual_hosts" TARGET="_new">/boot/home/config/settings/virtual_hosts</A>. This file specifies the port of each
	server, the Webroot and Index Document associated with each Virtual Host name, and the Virtual
	Resources and Realms of each Virtual Host. The format of the virtual hosts file 
	has changed since the initial release of Robin Hood (version 0.9). The file has been renamed for this reason.</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Server</B></FONT>
		<BR>An independant web server with its own collection of virtual hosts. 
		Each server runs on its own TCP port; the default TCP port for HTTP is port 80. 
		Other ports may be accessed by using the following syntax from your browser: <BR>
		http://host-name:port/path<BR>
		Example: http://www.foo-bar.org:2100/</LI>
		<P><LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Virtual Host</B></FONT>
		<BR>It is possible for one web server to service multiple 
		domain names. For example, you may own the domains <I>www.foo-bar.org</I> and 
		<I>www.mr-happy.com</I> and wish to host both on the same machine. Virtual Hosts 
		provides the mechanism by which this can be done. If the host was not specified 
		in the request or the host specified does not exist in the Virtual Hosts file, the 
		Virtual Host named <I>Default-Host</I> is used.</LI>
		<P><LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Webroot</B></FONT>
		<BR>Each Virtual Host has its own virtual root directory. For example, 
		if the Webroot of the Virtual Host <I>www.foo-bar.org</I> was "/boot/home/public_html/", 
		the URL <I>http://www.foo-bar.org/foo/bar.html</I> would refer to the file 
		"/boot/home/public_html/foo/bar.html" on your computer. It is not possible to access 
		files outside of the virtual root directory without using a symbolic link.</LI>
		<P><LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Index</B></FONT>
		<BR>This is the Index Document to be used for each Virtual Host. It will be appended
		to the URL before parsing if a directory URL was requested. For example, 
		if the Webroot of the Virtual Host <I>www.foo-bar.org</I> was "/boot/home/public_html/"
		and the Index Document was "index.shtml", the URL <I>http://www.foo-bar.org/</I> would
		return the file "/boot/home/public_html/index.shtml" on your computer. The Index Document
		is set to "index.html" by default if not specified.</LI>
		<P><LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Virtual Resource</B></FONT>
		<BR>Each Virtual Host maintains its own list of Virtual Resources. 
		Virtual Resources provides the means to define resouces which don't actually exist 
		as a file on your computer. A virtual resource is created dynamically by one of the 
		loaded add-on modules as needed. For example, the <I>RHDirectoryHandler</I> can
		create a directory listing when the "index.html" file is missing and it can
		create PNG images for Tracker icons.<BR><BR>
		Virtual Resources are also used to define Virtual MIME types. A Virtual MIME type 
		changes the MIME type of a file for the purpose of selecting which add-on module 
		to use. For example, all files ending in ".cgi" could be treated as CGIs instead 
		of their native MIME types.</LI>
		<P><LI><FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><B>Realm</B></FONT>
		<BR>Each Virtual Host has a list of Realms associated with it.
		When a resource is requested for which public access has not been granted, the
		resource's Realm defines the user name and password required to access the
		resource. Realm membership is defined by one or more file patterns. If 
		no Realms are defined for a Virtual Host, all files belong to the Realm "Sherwood."
		"Sherwood" has the same user name and password as set in the Network Preferences 
		panel.</LI>
	</UL>
	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>CGI Setup</B></FONT>
	<P>CGIs are detected by MIME type. All files with the MIME type
	"application/x-vnd.CGI" will be dispatched to the CGI Handler add-on module (if
	it's installed). The default Virtual Hosts file contains a Virtual Resource
	which will cause all files ending in .cgi and all files located within the cgi
	-bin/ directory to be treated as CGIs. You can change this behavior if you wish
	by editing the Virtual Hosts file.<BR>
	You can find more information about CGIs and some sample CGIs at 
	<A href="http://www.cgi-resources.com/" TARGET="_new">The CGI Resource Index</A>.</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>PHP Setup</B></FONT>
	<P>PHP is a server-side, cross-platform, HTML embedded scripting language.
	Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique
	PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web
	developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.
	The default Virtual Hosts file contains a Virtual Resource which will cause
	all files with the MIME type "application/x-httpd-php" or ending with ".php"
	to be treated as PHP.<BR>
	You can find more information about PHP at <A href="http://www.php.net/" TARGET="_new">PHP.net</A>.</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>SSI Setup</B></FONT>
	<P>Server Side Includes provide a mechanisim for creating dynamic HTML
	pages. A SSI file (usually ends with ".shtml") looks like a normal HTML file, but
	contains directives to the server to inline other text elements in the document
	from other sources. The source can be a static text document (like a HTML
	document), another SHTML document (which will also be processed), a CGI, or a
	shell command. SHTML documents are created on the fly by the server and the
	client never sees the original SHTML file. Files with a MIME type of "text/x
	-server-parsed-html" will be processed by the SSI Handler before delivery. The
	default Virtual Hosts file contains a Virtual Resource which will cause all
	files ending with ".shtml" be treated as SSIs.<BR>
	See <A href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html" TARGET="_new">NCSA HTTPd Tutorial: Server Side Includes</A> for more information on using SSIs.
