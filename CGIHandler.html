	<P>The CGI Handler is compliant with the CGI 1.1 Internet Draft 01. It will
	attempt to execute the resource specified in the URL and return the output of
	the sub-process. Parsed Header Output as well as Non-Parsed Header Output are
	supported by the CGI Handler. All standard CGI envrionment variables are made
	available to the sub-process. The CGI handler can execute any scripts which can 
	be executed from the shell. This includes compiled binaries, shell scripts, Perl, and 
	any other scripting language you may have installed. To use Perl you will have to install 
	Perl on your computer. You can find Perl for BeOS at <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/" TARGET="_new">BeBits</A>.
	
	<P>Compiled CGIs should run without needing any modification. If the CGI is written 
	in a scripting language such as a shell script or Perl, you may need to modify the 
	script to get it to run. The first line of such a script tells the shell which program 
	to use to interpret the script. This line is known as the "shebang" line. It has the 
	following form: #!path
	<BR>"path" is the absolute path of the script interpreter. For example, the shebang line for 
	a shell script would be <I>#!/bin/sh</I>. You can find the path for Perl by typing 
	"which perl" at the command line. This will probably give you "/boot/home/config/bin/perl" 
	or something similar under BeOS. The following is a sample shell script CGI which will 
	print the output of the fortune program:
	<FONT COLOR="#6495DE"><PRE>#!/bin/sh
echo Content-type: text/plain
echo
	
/bin/fortune
	</PRE></FONT>

	Some Non-Parsed Header CGIs may cause trouble with HTTP/1.1 clients.
	HTTP/1.1 clients maintain persistant connections by default and if the CGI does
	not send a "Content-Length" header or a "Connection: close" header, the client
	may become confused as to the content length of the response.
	
	<P>Visit the <A href="http://www.cgi-resources.com/" TARGET="_new">CGI Resources</A> web site for 
	more information on using and writing CGIs. They also maintain an index of useful CGI 
	scripts you may wish to use.<BR>
