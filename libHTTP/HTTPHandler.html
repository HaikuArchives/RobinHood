	<H2>Overview</H2><BR>
	<P>HTTPHandler objects are responsible for handling request messages. 
	When a request needs to be processed, the handler is passed a 
	HTTPRequest message through its MessageReceived() method. See HTTPListener 
	for more information on the relation of HTTPListener to HTTPHandler.</P>

	<PRE>
	virtual bool MessageReceived( HTTPRequest *request )</PRE>
	<P>MessageReceived() is called when a HTTPListener needs to proccess a 
	request. It is the responsibility of the handler to send any reply which may 
	be needed. The return value is used to control the connection. By default, 
	the listener-created connection thread will maintain a HTTP/1.1 connection 
	when a HTTP/1.1 request is received. The connection-thread's 
	will send the required HTTP/1.1 100 Continue message before it calls 
	MessageReceived(). If for some reason the connection should need to be closed 
	after the MessageReceived() is called, MessageReceived() should return false. 
	Otherwise it should return true if a persistant connection can be maintained. 
	The connection should be closed if the response sent did not include a 
	content-length header as may be the case when CGIs and other dynamic content are 
	involved. If the response message sent to the client did not include a content-length 
	header it MUST contain a "Connection: close" header and MessageReceived() MUST 
	return false in order for the client to know where the end of the entity-body 
	is.</P>
