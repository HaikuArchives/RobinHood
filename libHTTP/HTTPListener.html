	<H2>Overview</H2><BR>
	<P>The HTTPListener class is analogeous to the BLooper class. It waits to
	receive messages in its own thread over TCP and passes them to a HTTPHandler
	object by means of the handler's MessageReceived() method. It differs from the
	BLooper/BHandler model in certain aspects. When a connection is opened, a new
	handler thread is created and a copy of the template handler is created to
	handle requests on that connection. The listener returns immediatly to wait
	for new connections, while the handler thread processes the request messages.</P>
	
	<P>The connection thread manages the connection, receives requests on that connection, 
	and passes properly formatted requests to the handler via MessageReceived(). 
	The connection thread implements HTTP/1.1 persistant connections; it can receive 
	multiple requests over the same TCP conneciton.</P>
	<P>The handler is responsible for sending any reply that may be required.</P>

	<H3>HTTPListener()</H3><BR>
	<PRE>
	HTTPListener( HTTPHandler *handler, unsigned short port = 80, int acceptance_count = 32 )</PRE>
	<P>Creates and initializes a HTTPListener object. The <I>hander</I> is a template 
	handler. Ownership of the template handler is retained by the caller and it must 
	not be deleted while the listener is running. The template is not actually used to handle the requests. 
	The template's NewCopy() method is called when the listener needs another 
	hander to process a connection.</P>
	<P>The <I>port</I> argument is the TCP port number on the HTTPListener will listen. 
	The defualt port for HTTP is port 80. The <I>acceptance_count</I> is the number 
	of TCP connections the listener is willing to accept at a time. Connections are 
	refused when the the number of active connections reaches the <I>acceptance_count</I>.</P>
