	<H1>libHTTP 0.9</H1>
	<BR>
	<P>libHTTP is free object-based shared library for BeOS which implements the
	Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) version 1.1. HTTP is the protocol used by
	the WWW to transfer documents. In additon to providing a high level HTTP
	interface, libHTTP provides a collection of objects for communicating via the
	TCP and UDP protocols as well as a number of usefull supporting objects and
	functions. It is an original work designed from the ground-up for BeOS; it
	contains no ported code. </P>
	
	<P>This is the initial release of this library. I do not consider it
	complete at this time; it may contain serious bugs and some features are
	incomplete. You may also find portions of this documentatin to be incomplete. It has
	been released under the terms of the <A href="lgpl.html">GNU Library General
	Public License</A>. This differs from the standard GPL by allowing certain
	propriatary software to link with this library without violating the license.
	Please help the effort to make this library more usefull by submitting
	sugestions, bug reports/fixes, and any other support you may wish to offer.</P>
	<BR>
	<H3>High-Level HTTP Client Interface</H3>
	<P>If you are writing an HTTP client, you may find the HTTP_Io class meets
	your needs. This class is modeled after the BFile class. It is a BPositionIO
	derived object which can manipulate the URL resource specified by its SetTo()
	method. Seeking will work, provided the remote server supports byte-ranges.
	Currently it is a read-only object; write support will be added in a future
	release of this library. This object supports HTTP/1.1 persistant
	connections.</P>
	
	<H3>General HTTP Interface</H3>
	<P>This interface is used if you are writing a server or a client which
	needs more control than the HTTP_Io class provides. This interface is some-what
	modeled after the BeOS Messaging System ( No, the HTTP objects are not derived
	from BLooper, BMessage, BHandler, etc. ). HTTP Messages are represented and
	mainipulated by the HTTPMessage derived objects: HTTPRequest and HTTPResponse.
	The HTTPMessage objects do not assume any specific transport mechanism (like
	TCP) and can read from and write to any BDataIO derived object. A program which
	wishes to receive HTTPMessages over a TCP interface may use the HTTPListener and
	HTTPHandler objects, which are analogous to BLooper and BHandler respectively. A
	HTTPListener object listens on its specified TCP port for HTTP requests and
	passes them to a copy of its designted HTTPHandler by calling the handler's
	MessageReceived() method. This process differs a bit from the BeOS Messaging
	Model. Where a BHandler is called in the same thread as its BLooper, each
	HTTPHandler object runs in its own thread and is a copy of the template handler
	object provided to the listener. This permits the HTTPListener to handle
	multiple requests simultaneously. In addition to invoking the
	HTTPHandler::MessageReceived() method, the thread created by the listener for
	the handler is responsible for managing the TCP connection. If the client is
	using HTTP/1.1, multiple requests may be received over the same TCP
	connection.</P>
	
	<P>A sample HTTPHandler derived class is provided. This is the
	HTTPFileServer class. This class implements a simple file server and serves as
	the basis for Robin Hood; a free web server based on libHTTP.</P>
	
	<H3>TCP/IP Interface</H3>
	<P>The Socket_Io derived classes, TCP_IO and UDP_IO, provide BDataIO based
	wrappers for the BSD sockets interface. They were created to allow HTTPMessage
	objects, which only perform IO on BDataIO derived objects, to communicate over
	TCP. I believe they provide a cleaner, more Be-like interface to the TCP/IP
	protocol stack than the BSD sockets interface. You may find them usefull for
	protocols other than HTTP.</P>
	
	<H3>DataIO Utilities</H3>
	A number of BDataIO derived classes and other related utilities are provided by 
	this library.</P>
	<P>The FileIO and DesIO classes provide BDataIO wrappers for streams 
	and file descripters. This is handy for allowing HTTPMessages to talk to pipes and 
	other descripter based io entities.</P>
	<P>The class DataIOPump can provide buffered data transfers between any 
	two BDataIO derived objects.</P>
	<P>The BufferedIO class is a wrapper for other BDataIO objects. It provides 
	buffered writes. This may be usefull when many small writes are made to a TCP_IO 
	object.</P>
	<P>The functions io_printf() and io_getline() are usefull for formatted output 
	and line-based input on BDataIO derived objects.
	
	<H3>More Info on HTTP</H3>
	<P>HTTP is the primary protocol used by the World Wide Web. It is superior
	to FTP for many applications. HTTP not only has provisions for retrieval of data
	entities, it can also modify them, much like FTP. ( Yes, you can actually upload
	files via HTTP. ) Unlike FTP, it can specify the underlying data-type of the
	entity via mime types. It can also provide a powerfull interface to remote
	databases by means of its query mechanisim.</P>
	<P>HTTP is a quasi-datagram based messaging protocol. It is usually
	implemented on top of a stream based protocol such as TCP, but could use other
	protocols for transport. HTTP communicates by means of messages; allmost
	datagram like entities. Each message consists of a start-line followed by a
	variable number of headers and an optional variable-length entity-body. HTTP
	messages can be sub-divided into requests and responses. A HTTP transaction
	consists a request being sent to a recipient and the recipient sending a
	response back to the requesting entity.</P>
	<P>A request message's start-line is known as the request-line. It consists 
	of a Method token, a URI, and the HTTP version being used. The most common 
	Method is "GET"; it requests the entity specified by the URI be returned in 
	the response. Other Methods include: HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, and TRACE.</P>
	<P>The start-line of a response is know as the status-line. It contains the 
	HTTP version supported, a status-code, and a human readable reason phrase. In 
	response to a "GET" request, the requested resource is typically returned in 
	the entity-body portion of the response.</P>
	<P>HTTP can be used for more than file transfers on the Web. It can be used as 
	a general purpose remote messaging protocol between programs. You could even 
	transport BMessages via HTTP.</P>
	<P>For the definitive HTTP/1.1 protocol specification, see RFC 2068. RFC 1945 
	specifies the earlier HTTP/1.0 protocol and may be better suited as an 
	introduction to HTTP.
